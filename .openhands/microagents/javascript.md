# JavaScript Knowledge Microagent

This microagent provides comprehensive information about JavaScript when triggered.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It's a dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based language with first-class functions.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Typing**: Variables don't need explicit type declarations
- **Prototype-based OOP**: Objects can inherit directly from other objects
- **First-class Functions**: Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions
- **Event-driven Programming**: Responds to user interactions and system events
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Supports callbacks, promises, and async/await

## Core Concepts

### Variables and Data Types
- `var`, `let`, `const` for variable declarations
- Primitive types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint
- Reference types: objects, arrays, functions

### Functions
- Function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions
- Closures and scope
- Higher-order functions

### Objects and Arrays
- Object literal notation
- Array methods (map, filter, reduce, forEach, etc.)
- Destructuring assignment

### Asynchronous JavaScript
- Callbacks and callback hell
- Promises and Promise chaining
- async/await syntax
- Event loop and microtasks

## Modern JavaScript (ES6+)

- Template literals
- Destructuring
- Spread and rest operators
- Classes
- Modules (import/export)
- Map and Set collections
- Generators and iterators

## JavaScript Environments

- **Browser**: DOM manipulation, event handling, AJAX
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript, file system access, networking
- **Mobile**: React Native, Ionic
- **Desktop**: Electron

## Popular Frameworks and Libraries

- **Frontend**: React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte
- **Backend**: Express.js, Koa.js, Fastify
- **Testing**: Jest, Mocha, Cypress
- **Build Tools**: Webpack, Vite, Parcel

## Best Practices

- Use strict mode (`'use strict'`)
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Handle errors properly with try-catch
- Avoid global variables
- Use modern ES6+ features
- Follow consistent code formatting

## Common Gotchas

- Hoisting behavior with `var`
- `this` binding in different contexts
- Truthy and falsy values
- Type coercion
- Asynchronous behavior understanding

JavaScript is constantly evolving with new features added regularly through ECMAScript specifications. It's essential for web development and increasingly popular for full-stack development.
