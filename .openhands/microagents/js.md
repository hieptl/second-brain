# JavaScript Knowledge

This microagent provides information about JavaScript when triggered.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Typing**: Variables don't need explicit type declarations
- **First-Class Functions**: Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions
- **Prototype-Based Object Orientation**: Objects can inherit directly from other objects
- **Event-Driven Programming**: Responds to user interactions and system events
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Supports callbacks, promises, and async/await

## Common Use Cases

1. **Web Development**: Client-side scripting for interactive websites
2. **Server-Side Development**: Node.js for backend applications
3. **Mobile App Development**: React Native, Ionic
4. **Desktop Applications**: Electron framework
5. **Game Development**: Browser-based games
6. **API Development**: RESTful services and GraphQL

## Basic Syntax Examples

### Variables
```javascript
let name = "John";
const age = 30;
var isActive = true;
```

### Functions
```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

### Objects and Arrays
```javascript
const person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 25,
    hobbies: ["reading", "coding", "gaming"]
};

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

## Modern JavaScript Features

- **ES6+ Features**: Arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, modules
- **Async/Await**: Modern asynchronous programming
- **Classes**: Object-oriented programming syntax
- **Modules**: Import/export functionality
- **Spread Operator**: Easy array and object manipulation

## Popular Frameworks and Libraries

- **React**: UI library for building user interfaces
- **Vue.js**: Progressive framework for building UIs
- **Angular**: Full-featured framework for web applications
- **Node.js**: Runtime for server-side JavaScript
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js

JavaScript continues to evolve with regular updates and remains one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
