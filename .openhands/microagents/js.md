# JavaScript Knowledge Microagent

This microagent provides comprehensive information about JavaScript when triggered.

## JavaScript Overview

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Typing**: Variables don't need explicit type declarations
- **First-Class Functions**: Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions
- **Prototype-Based Object Orientation**: Objects can inherit directly from other objects
- **Event-Driven Programming**: Responds to user interactions and system events
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Supports callbacks, promises, and async/await

## Core Concepts

### Variables and Data Types
- `var`, `let`, `const` for variable declarations
- Primitive types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint
- Reference types: objects, arrays, functions

### Functions
- Function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions
- Closures and scope
- Higher-order functions

### Objects and Arrays
- Object literal notation
- Array methods (map, filter, reduce, forEach, etc.)
- Destructuring assignment

### Asynchronous JavaScript
- Callbacks and callback hell
- Promises and promise chaining
- Async/await syntax
- Event loop and concurrency model

## Modern JavaScript (ES6+)

- Template literals
- Destructuring
- Spread and rest operators
- Classes and inheritance
- Modules (import/export)
- Map, Set, WeakMap, WeakSet
- Generators and iterators

## Runtime Environments

- **Browser**: DOM manipulation, Web APIs, client-side scripting
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript, file system access, networking
- **Other**: React Native, Electron, serverless functions

## Popular Frameworks and Libraries

- **Frontend**: React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte
- **Backend**: Express.js, Koa.js, Fastify
- **Testing**: Jest, Mocha, Cypress
- **Build Tools**: Webpack, Vite, Parcel

## Best Practices

- Use strict mode (`'use strict'`)
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Handle errors properly with try/catch
- Avoid global variables
- Use modern ES6+ features
- Follow consistent code formatting
- Write unit tests

## Common Patterns

- Module pattern
- Observer pattern
- Factory pattern
- Singleton pattern
- MVC/MVP/MVVM architectures

JavaScript continues to evolve with annual ECMAScript releases, making it a versatile and powerful language for both frontend and backend development.
